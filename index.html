        <h1>Brooklyn Nine-nine Season 7 Out Now!</h1>


        <p> With Madeline Wuntch (Kyra Sedgwick) demoting Holt in the Season 6 finale, the 99 will have to deal with the change in power dynamics in the precinct. In a first look preview trailer on TVLine, Crews said of the upcoming episodes,
          "the
          fact is that he's still captain to us, but it's such a different position for him." Terry will have particularly tricky time, have to take over Holt's role as captain. Lo Truglio said of this, "The rest of the squad is learning how to
          relate to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords running the show."
        </p>
        <p> The trailer for the series also teases the return of Jimmy Jab Games, while Beatriz teases, "If you thought these episodes were packed with stuff before, get ready..."
        </p>
        <p> Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 7 stars February 6 on NBC

    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="flex-grid">

      <div class="col">
        <p> From Emmy Award-winning writer/producers Dan Goor and Michael Schur ("Parks and Recreation"), and starring Emmy Award winners Andy Samberg ("Saturday Night Live") and Andre Braugher ("Men of a Certain Age," "Homicide: Life on the
          Street"), BROOKLYN NINE-NINE is a new single-camera ensemble comedy about what happens when a talented, but carefree, detective gets a new captain with a lot to prove.</p>
        <p>
          Detective Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is a good enough cop that he's never had to work that hard or follow the rules too closely. Perhaps because he has the best arrest record among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged -
          throughout his entire career. That is, until the precinct gets a new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt (Andre Braugher ), who reminds this hotshot cop to respect the badge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jake may have collared more criminals, but Detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero, "One Life to Live," "Gossip Girl") is close behind, and she's keenly aware of how many arrests she needs to close the gap. Amy grew up with seven
          brothers
          who were all cops. She's the first girl in the family to put on a police uniform, and suffice it to say: she's extremely competitive...about everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also working cases in Brooklyn's 99th precinct is Sergeant Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews, "Bridesmaids," "Everybody Hates Chris"), a linebacker of a man who's lost his nerve, not because he's a wimp, but because a year ago, his wife had
          twin
          baby girls - Cagney and Lacey - and he can't imagine not seeing them grow up. Detective Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio, "Wreck-It Ralph," "Superbad"), who idolizes Jake, is the precinct's workhorse; he's not that brilliant, he's not
          physically gifted, but he tries harder than anyone else. Charles pines for Detective Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz, "Modern Family," "The Closer"), with whom he stands no chance at all. Rosa is simultaneously tough, sexy and scary as
          hell.
          She's vocally opinionated about everything. Cleaning up everyone's mess is Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti, "Parks and Recreation," "Kroll Show"), the eccentric, civilian office manager who somehow gets involved in everyone's business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, these tightly knit - or is it tightly wound? - cops interrogate suspects, arrest perps and solve murders. But, ultimately, BROOKLYN NINE-NINE is a workplace comedy that's not really about the job. It's about the men and women
          behind the badge - singing karaoke, grabbing a beer and hitting on each other - all while protecting the fine people of Brooklyn.
